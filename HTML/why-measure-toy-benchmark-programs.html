    <h3 id="why-measure">So, why measure toy benchmark programs?</h3>
    <p>You don't have time to inspect the source code of real applications to check that different implementations are kind-of comparable. Is it <b>really</b> the same program when written in different programming languages?
    <p>You do have time to inspect 100-line programs. You do have time to write 100-line programs. You still might have something to learn from how other people write 100-line programs.
    <p id="non-motivation">Non-motivation: We are profoundly uninterested in claims that these measurements, of a few tiny programs, somehow <b>define</b> the relative performance of programming languages.
