    <h3 id="verify">Trust, but verify</h3>
    <p>Sometimes people just make up stuff because the facts don't fit <b>the story they want to tell you</b>. 
    <p>You will probably come across stuff that people say about the benchmarks game. Do they show that what they claim is true? If they provide a URL, does the content actually confirm what they say?
    <p>Perhaps they are genuinely mistaken. Perhaps the content changed.

    <p>JVM start-up, JIT, OSR&hellip; are quickly effective and typical cold / warmed-up comparison at most of these workloads will show miniscule difference. Note the exception.
    <p>(<q>In stark contrast to the traditional expectation of <q>warmup</q>, some benchmarks exhibit <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00602"><q>slowdown</q></a>, where the performance of in-process iterations drops over time.</q>)

    <h3 id="ridicule"><q> <q>Прогрелось</q>. Но работает минимум в 65x медленнее
– Поэтому супер-оптимизация&hellip;</q></h3>
    <p>No. The repeated measurements of the Java pi-digits program without restarting the JVM, did not make the Java program seem 65x slower. 
    <p>That really would have been ridiculous. The JavaOne expert's slides mysteriously fail to show that the sum was correctly divided by 65 to give an average.

    <h3 id="dispute"><q>&hellip;to dispute a decision you basically need to pray the maintainer reopens it for some reason.</q></h3>
    <p>No. Followup comments can always be made in the project ticket tracker. There's a public discussion forum, etc. etc.
    <p>Someone's <q>brilliant hack</q> was rejected. Someone took the opportunity to push traffic to their personal blog.

    <h3 id="name-game"><q>There's a reason they call it <q>a game</q>&hellip;</q><br/> <q>It's <q>a game</q>&hellip;</q></h3>
    <p>The name "benchmarks game" signifies nothing more than the fact that programmers contribute programs that compete (but try to remain comparable) for fun not money.
    <p>It's what you make of it.

    <h3 id="history">Once upon a time&hellip;</h3>
    <p>Doug Bagley had a burst of crazy curiosity: <q><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010124090400/http://www.bagley.org/~doug/shootout/">When I started this project</a>, my goal was to compare all the major scripting languages. Then I started adding in some compiled languages for comparison&hellip;</q> 
    <p>That project was abandoned in 2002, restarted in 2004 by Brent Fulgham and continued from 2008 by Isaac Gouy. Everything has changed; several times.
    <p>Alioth hosting service was deprecated and will vanish 2018-05-01. So this website will vanish 2018-05-01.
