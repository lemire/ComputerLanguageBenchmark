\ BENCHMARK
\ run the test ITER @ times
: benchmark  0 ITER @ 0 do  primes nip loop ;


\ now print count of how many Flags are now "true"
." Count: " benchmark  1 u.r cr


\ PPRIMES
\ for testing, we can print out all the prime numbers
: pprimes ( -- )
    \ from index =  to 
    SIZE 0
    do
	\ add the loop counter to the start address of array Flags
	\ and test if the flag at that address is true
	Flags i + c@
	\ ps: (Flags[i])

	    \ if so, print array index + 2
	    i 2 + .
        then
    loop
    cr

\ END PPRIMES

\ uncomment the following to print the primes or debug
\ pprimes
\ flags 100 dump
